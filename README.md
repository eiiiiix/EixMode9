__GodMode9 has commands that EixMode9 does not have.__
please be careful with newer scripts

M:vram.mem contains a thank you list and ReiSix firm.

## Issues

If you find a bug or issue, please make it here.
Issues are also accepted on my Discord Server.
AL3X10MODE only has half support, if you find an issue in it i will try to fix it but if you find an issue in EIXMODE or SALTMODE that issue will be given higher priority as EixMode9 is focused on EIXMODE and SALTMODE.

If you make an issue in leet speak (1337 5934k 3L173 H4%0r5 L4n6u463) it will be ignored.
__Please only make issues in normal languages (I.E. English, Spanish, German, Klingon (I have a Klingon dictonary, I can translate it), French, Japanese, Veitnese, or Chinese).__ I would prefer issues to be written in English because English is my main language. I have Google Translate, Bing Translate, my sister, my friend SirNapkin1334 (he speaks German) and my Klingon dictonary if you're bad at English.

## Discord

I have a Discord link as the splash message.
In order to get access to the EixMode9 channels you must type `?joineix`
My Discord will be printed upon successful compilation from source as well.

## Why I decided to put ReiSix instead of Luma3DS 9.0

Luma3ds extracts the native firm from the NAND, so if the native firm is missing, Luma fails to mount the CTRNAND.
ReiNand uses an external native firm (firmware.bin/nativefirmware.bin) therefore, if the native firm is missing from the NAND ReiNand is still able to mount the NAND properly.
Although Luma3DS is smaller (~80KB) and ReiSix is larger (~1.9MB) I still feel that ReiSix is better. If you don't like it, delete it from the /data directory before compiling.
ReiNand is currently equal, if not better than Luma3DS, in my opinion, even though it has different features.

If you don't understand what I mean look for the "Why Rei" section of EixMode9_ReadMe in the /data directory
