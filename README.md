This is a WIP for something i was told by somebody i wont mention was impossible
(basically it might be able to install CIA's on arm9)
ignore this for now

i deleted alot of files for this branch because they are not needed for what im doing
there will likely be alot more stuff i delete in this branch

CITFA9 will be a project that is very different from GodMode9 or EixMode9 but since it uses alot of the GodMode9 source code CITFA9 will be staying as a branch of EixMode9 for now
if CITFA9 works as intended it will be a ntrboot only payload and will have a different repo since its going to be so different

most of the source files will be deleted but as of right now i dont know which parts will stay so im not going to delete any big source files for now
