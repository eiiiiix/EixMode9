##
Important information

###
Perms system
This mod of GodMode9 (GodMode9 belongs to d0k3) has a
diffrent perms system, all perms are unlocked from the
start

####
Warenty
There is no warenty, you break it you fix it

####
Missing Perms

mounted files (someday i hope we can edit mounted files)
Do not get mad that you cant edit them

Drive 8
Only certain systems have a bonus drive, and the bonus
drive can be anywhere from 4mb to over 600mb
As far as i know only n3ds has the bonus drive, ive never
seen a o3ds bonus drive
Dont be mad if you dont have one

###
Bugs and problems
Report any bugs or problems you find in this to me, not
d0k3
This is a mod of GodMode9 meaning that you will not get
any support from d0k3 if you have issues
Only report bugs and issues to me, dont complain about
accidently doing something, i will ignore you if you do
that

####
Suggestions
I accept suggestions but only if they are feasible, no
write to game cart crap (i would love gamecart wrightts
too)
Please keep suggestions to a minimum though

##
ELUA crap
In using this software you cannot blame the devs of
anything related to GodMode9 by d0k3
You can also not claim "accident" when you accidently
delete a important system file
You are using this at your own risk

Why ReiNand?
Okay, so here's a crappy explanation/ranking based on features.

Each feature is worth 1 point
Availible=1
Not a feature=0
In-between/else=0.5
C is for the casual section, non casual section, and joke section
N is for the non casual section, and joke section
J is for the joke section
                                    (Rei, Luma, Cakes)
C1. Supports NTR overlay/SVC backdoor: yes, yes, yes
N2. Supports IPS patching: sorta, yes, no
C3. Has built in chainloader: no, yes but it messes with the b9s enviroment, no
N4. Has a config: doesnt need one, yes, yes
N5. Supports CTRNAND booting (boot.firm in ctrnand): yes but supposedly buggy, yes, unknown
N6. Can mount a CTRNAND thats missing its native firm: yes, no, yes
N7. Supports emunand: yes, very well, yes
N8. Supports dev unit apps: sorta, yes, idk never tried
N9. Supports patches that can modify system processes: yes, sorta, yes
C10. Can be drag-and-dropped with no need to know what your doing: yes, yes, somewhat
C11. Can be installed to a FIRM partition: no, yes, no

ReiSix score: 7.5
Luma3ds score: 9
CakesFW score: 6.5

Okay, I guess maybe Luma IS objectively better then Rei, but SCREW IT, I DON'T CARE!!!! If you don't like it, compile it yourself and take Rei out of the /data folder.
