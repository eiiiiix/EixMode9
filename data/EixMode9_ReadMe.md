Important information

###

This mod of GodMode9 (GodMode9 belongs to d0k3) has a
diffrent perms system, all perms are unlocked from the
start

####
Warenty
There is no warenty, you break it you fix it

####

mounted files (someday i hope we can edit mounted files)
Do not get mad that you cant edit them

Drive 8
Only certain systems have a bonus drive, and the bonus
drive can be anywhere from 4mb to over 600mb
As far as i know only n3ds has the bonus drive, ive never
seen a o3ds bonus drive
Dont be mad if you dont have one

###
Bugs and problems
Report any bugs or problems you find in this to me, not
d0k3
This is a mod of GodMode9 meaning that you will not get
any support from d0k3 if you have issues
Only report bugs and issues to me, dont complain about
accidently doing something, i will ignore you if you do
that

####
Suggestions
I accept suggestions but only if they are feasible, no
write to game cart crap (i would love gamecart writes
too)
Please keep suggestions to a minimum though
you can make suggestions in #suggestions on my discord server (in the EixMode9 section) or by making an issue here with the label [suggestion]

##
ELUA crap
In using this software you cannot blame the devs of
anything related to GodMode9 by d0k3
You can also not claim "accident" when you accidently
delete a important system file
You are using this at your own risk

Why ReiSix?
Okay, so here's a crappy explanation/ranking based on features.

Each feature is worth 1 point
Availible/Not needed=1
Not a feature=0
In-between/else=0.5
C is for the casual section, non casual section, and joke section
N is for the non casual section, and joke section
                                    (ReiSix, Luma3ds, CakesFW, ReiNand)
C1. Supports NTR overlay/SVC backdoor: yes, yes, yes, no
N2. Supports IPS patching: sorta, yes, sorta, sorta
C3. Has built in chainloader: no, yes but it messes with the b9s enviroment, no, no
N4. Has a config: doesnt need one, yes, yes, doesnt need one
N5. Supports CTRNAND booting (boot.firm in ctrnand): yes but supposedly buggy, yes, idk, no
N6. Can mount a CTRNAND thats missing its native firm: yes, no, yes, yes
N7. Supports emunand: yes, yes but still uses some stuff from sysnand, yes, yes
N8. Supports dev unit apps: sorta, yes, idk never tried, yes
N9. Supports patches that can modify system processes: yes, sorta, yes, yes
C10. Can be drag-and-dropped with no need to know what your doing: yes, yes, somewhat, yes

ReiSix score: N7.5 C2
Luma3ds score: N7 (Mass Effect!) C2.5
CakesFW score: N7 (Mass Effect!) C1.5
ReiNand score: N6.5 C1

for non casual users ReiSix is the best option
and EixMode9 is meant for power users (IE: non casual users)
while all the scores are very close, they are not 100% correct, if you are an advanced user or know what your doing the CakesFW can be the best option here (unless you use Corbenik)
Luma3ds has the best score for casual users because it has all the stuff that a noob wants or that someone who doesnt want to do too much wants
ReiNand may have the lowest overall score, but it is insanely useful

these scores are meant for the broadest possible results
going on what i would give for my personal use it would be as follows

because you are not Eix (unless you are Eix) these results do not apply to you
personal results are for an individual and what xhe uses it for

ReiSix: 8.5
Luma3ds: 4
CakesFW: 7 (Mass Effect!)
ReiNand: 8

if you do not want to have ReiSix in the vram then download the source and delete ~/data/rei and ~/data/ReiSix_1.1.firm
it will save ~2mb that you can use for other stuff
like the cfw of your choice if it fits
or support files
or pictures of Megumin
