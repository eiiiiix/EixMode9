Bugs and problems
Report any bugs or problems you find in this to me, not

any support from d0k3 if you have issues
Only report bugs and issues to me, dont complain about
accidently doing something, i will ignore you if you do
that

I accept suggestions but only if they are feasible, no
write to game cart crap (i would love gamecart writes
too)
Please keep suggestions to a minimum though
you can make suggestions in #suggestions on my discord server (in the EixMode9 section) or by making an issue here with the label [suggestion]

if you do not want to have ReiSix in the vram then download the source and delete ~/data/rei and ~/data/ReiSix_1.2.firm
it will save ~2mb that you can use for other stuff
like the cfw of your choice if it fits
or support files
or pictures of Megumin
