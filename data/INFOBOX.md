Why ReiNand?
Okay, so here's a crappy explanation/ranking based on features.

Each feature is worth 1 point
Availible=1
Not a feature=0
In-between/else=0.5
C is for the casual section, non casual section, and joke section
N is for the non casual section, and joke section
J is for the joke section
                                    (Rei, Luma, Cakes)
C1. Supports NTR overlay/SVC backdoor: yes, yes, yes
N2. Supports IPS patching: sorta, yes, no
C3. Has built in chainloader: no, yes but it messes with the b9s enviroment, no
N4. Has a config: doesnt need one, yes, yes
N5. Supports CTRNAND booting (boot.firm in ctrnand): yes but supposedly buggy, yes, unknown
N6. Can mount a CTRNAND thats missing its native firm: yes, no, yes
N7. Supports emunand: yes, very well, yes
N8. Supports dev unit apps: sorta, yes, idk never tried
N9. Supports patches that can modify system processes: yes, sorta, yes
C10. Can be drag-and-dropped with no need to know what your doing: yes, yes, somewhat
C11. Can be installed to a FIRM partition: no, yes, no

ReiSix score: 7.5
Luma3ds score: 9
CakesFW score: 6.5

Okay, I guess maybe Luma IS objectively better then Rei, but SCREW IT, I DON'T CARE!!!! If you don't like it, compile it yourself and take Rei out of the /data folder.
